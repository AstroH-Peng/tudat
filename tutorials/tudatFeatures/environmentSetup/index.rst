Environment Set-up
==================
Models for the physical environment are one of the cornerstones of a numerical astrodynamics toolbox. Here, we define the environment in the broadest sense, including all physical properties of the solar system, such as atmospheres and gravity fields, but also any models for the orbits and rotations of these bodies.

On this page, we will give an overview of how the environment is represented in Tudat, which models have been implemented, and how to create the environment that is tailored to your needs.
